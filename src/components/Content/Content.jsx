            restaurant, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in Chelsea, London, has held
            three Michelin stars since 2001. After rising to fame on the British

          </p>
          <p>
            Ramsay's television appearances are defined by his bluntness, fiery
            temper, strict demeanour, and frequent use of profanity. He combines
            activities in the television, film, hospitality, and food
            industries, and has promoted and hired various chefs who have
            apprenticed under his wing. He is known for presenting television
            programmes about competitive cookery and food, such as the British
            series Hell's Kitchen (2004), Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares
            (2004–2009, 2014), and The F Word (2005–2010), with Kitchen
            Nightmares winning the 2005 British Academy Television Award for
            Best Feature, and the American versions of Hell's Kitchen
            (2005–present), Kitchen Nightmares (2007–2014), MasterChef
            (2010–present), and MasterChef Junior (2013–present), as well as
            Hotel Hell (2012–2016), Gordon Behind Bars (2012), Gordon Ramsay's
            24 Hours to Hell and Back (2018–2020), and Next Level Chef
            (2022–present).

          <p id="work">
            Ramsay has been involved in a series of charitable events and
            organisations. He fulfilled his aim of finishing 10 marathons in 10
            years by running his 10th consecutive London Marathon on 26 April
            2009, sponsoring the Scottish Spina Bifida Association. Ramsay has
            been Honorary Patron of the Scottish Spina Bifida Association since
            2004, and in 2005 he launched The Gordon Ramsay "Buy a Brick" appeal
            to help the organisation raise funds to build a new Family Support
            Centre and Head Office in Glasgow. In 2006, he launched a new appeal
            to help the charity raise the funds required to continue to run the
            support centre: "What's your favourite 'F' Word? Gordon's is
            Fundraising." In November 2007, Ramsay hosted a St Andrew's Day Gala
            Dinner at Stirling Castle in aid of the Association and has now made
            this fundraising Gala Dinner an annual event.[151] During March
            2005, Ramsay teamed up with Indian chef Madhur Jaffrey to help the
            VSO, an international development charity group, to support its
            Spice Up Your Life event. The charity hoped to raise £100,000 for
            VSO's work in HIV and AIDS in India. The Ramsays were the first
            couple to become ambassadors for the women's charity Women's Aid in
            2005. The couple ran the Flora Families marathon to support Women's
            Aid. In 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014, Ramsay took part in the
            biennial charity event Soccer Aid to raise money for UNICEF. On 6
            June 2010 he played for the Rest of the World team alongside former
            professional footballers Zinedine Zidane and Luís Figo as well as
            Hollywood actors Woody Harrelson, Mike Myers and Michael Sheen. The
            match took place at Old Trafford in Manchester and was won by the
            Rest of the World for the first time, the winning penalty scored by
            Harrelson in the shoot-out.
